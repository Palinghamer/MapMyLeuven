# MapMyLeuven 🗺️
A web application that aggregates events happening in Leuven and displays them on a map. 

The front-end is [hosted](https://palinghamer.github.io/MapMyLeuven/homepage.html) through github pages, and the back-end (Node.js) through Render.com. 

This is a work in progress (((; ఠ ਉ ఠ))
